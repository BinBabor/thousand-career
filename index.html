       sabya-sachi  encompasses many different skills and disciplines <br/>
       in the production and maintenance of websites. 
       The different areas of web design include web graphic design;<br/>
        interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software;
         user experience design;
          and search engine optimization.<br/>
           Often many individuals will work in teams covering different
            aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.
            [1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe 
            the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website<br/>
             including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the 
             broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness <br/>
             of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected 
             to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines. 
     <h3> expert on MARKRTING </h3>
     Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is an academic program <br/>
     at some universities that integrates the fields of computer engineering and computer science
     , providing knowledge of computing systems in both hardware and software design. <br/>
     The study program is modeled on German technical universities, where CS,
      CE and IT are treated as respectively the theoretical, <br/>
      technical and practical part of one field called "Informatik".

     Courses include computer architecture, processor design, operating systems,
      computer networks, parallel processing, embedded systems, circuit analysis,<br/>
       analog and digital electronics, computer graphics, cloud, web and mobile computing, 
       software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization,
        computer simulations and games programming.<br/>
         CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory
          of computation, design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, numerical analysis,<br/>
           machine learning, information theory, programming language theory and paradigms. 
           The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting <br/>
           computing devices and systems (such as personal computers, supercomputers, robots,
            smartphones, networking devices, embedded devices), focusing the underlying <br/>
            fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design
            , memory management, digital

  The outs. These sheets of lettering could be rubbed on anywhere and were quickly adopted by graphic artists, printers, architects, and advertisers for their professional look and ease of use.
     Aldus Corporation, which later merged with Adobe<br/>
     Systems, ushered lorem ipsum into the information 
     age with its desktop publishing software Aldus
     PageMaker. The program came bundled with lorem <br/>
     ipsum dummy text for laying out page content,
     and other word processors like Microsoft Word <br/>
     followed suit. More recently the growth of web design
     has helped proliferate lorem ipsum across the 
     internet as a placeholder for future text—and in <br/>
     some cases the final content (this is why we proofread,
     kids).
